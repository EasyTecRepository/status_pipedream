# Statuscheck with Pipedream.com
![Error](https://github.com/EasyTecRepository/status_pipedream/blob/main/images/Thumbnail_GitHub.png?raw=true)

## What is this?
This is a simple script that can check the current status of your services and create an incident on the status page if necessary.
All this works via Python scripts and the website pipedream.com.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not an advertisement!

## Wait, pipedream.com, what's that and why I use this?
With pipedream.com you have the possibility to run scripts on an external server. This is necessary, for example, if your home server is not available or you have problems with your network connection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the **free version** of Pipedream.com, it is only possible to **run** the check **script** a **maximum** of **10 times a day**. This means that it can only be executed **every 2.5 hours**.

## Why do I need that?
Because you want to know when your services are offline. So this is a must for anyone who has a few services to maintain.

## How do I get it?
Watch this [tutorial on YouTube (german)](https://youtube.com/EasyTec100) or read the following guide.
